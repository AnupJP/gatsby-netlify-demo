title: Motorists seeking shelter at underpasses
---
Motorists in Bengaluru will now be fined Rs 500 for seeking shelter at underpasses. Traffic police officials, on Thursday, announced that those halting below underpasses or bridges while trying to avoid rains will be penalised for ‘obstructing public roads’ and putting other road users in danger.

According to BR Ravikante Gowda, Joint commissioner of police (traffic), the decision was taken after four motorists sustained serious injuries after other vehicles rammed them in separate incidents across the city. Although nobody died in the incidents, two victims were badly injured.

He further added that first-time offenders would be fined Rs 500 while repeat offenders would be penalised Rs 1,000. “Most underpasses do not have proper lighting. When it rains, people can’t see anything until they reach the underpass. This is how the accidents happened,” explained Gowda.
